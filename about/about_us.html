We call it Tajness - the soul of our robust hospitality ecosystem that subtly guides all our behaviours. Tajness is the way we do, what we do. And as we step into a world of newer possibilities, the spirit of Tajness stands invigorated. Tajness – A Commitment Restrengthened is a mark of assurance of IHCL’s authentic Indian hospitality, with an added comfort of safety, hygiene and physical distancing.</b>

                <b>IHCL unveiled its three-pronged strategy to grow profitably in the coming years with Ahvaan 2025, the propeller of all of IHCL’s determined actions towards expanding its brandscape, delivering unmatched experiences and accelerating progress. It is priming the organisation to realise its futuristic vision through an evolving operating ecosystem. Under this strategy, IHCL will re-engineer its margins, re-imagine its brandscape and re-structure its portfolio. The goal of Ahvaan 2025 is to have a total of 300+ hotels, clock 33% EBITDA margin and have 35% EBITDA contribution from new businesses and management fees by FY 2025-26. IHCLs iconic and strongest brand Taj, its industry-leading ESG+ framework Paathya and a strong focus on digital will be the key enablers on this journey.</b>
